# World Cuisine

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view meals from 24 countries around the world, sourced from [The Meal DB Api](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). Users can choose an area to explore and view meal ideas from that area. Users can also drill down to see more details about the meal including ingredients and cooking instructions. 

## Installation

The `world_cuisine` CLI will be installed and you can run `bin/world_cuisine` to get a list of meal areas right in your command line. 

## Usage
